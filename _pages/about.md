Welcome! My expertise lies in the realm of high-performance software development. My primary focus is on crafting code for advanced computing platforms such as supercomputers, AWS clusters, and accelerators like GPUs. Additionally, I excel in enhancing the efficiency of existing codes that require a significant performance uplift. If you're seeking expertise in developing efficient parallel code, whether for single-board computers or massively parallel supercomputers, I am here to assist.

On this site, you can access my comprehensive resume, alongside direct links to my GitHub, Google Scholar profiles, and other contact and follow options. Additionally, I occasionally share my insights and experiences through blog posts.
