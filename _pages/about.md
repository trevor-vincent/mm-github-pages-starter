I am a computational astrophysicist with more than a decade of experience coding in C++, C and python. 
I have expert-level knowledge in numerical solution techniques for non-linear systems of partial differential equations and a broad knowledge of machine learning algorithms. I am an independent problem solver and researcher with lots of experience presenting scientific work (20+ epresentations) and communicating to audiences of different expertise.

For my PhD, I have developed next generation numerical methods for solving the Einstein field equations (General Relativity) on supercomputers and implemented them in a self-maintained 200,000-line code available on GitHub (github.com/trevor-vincent). Iâ€™ve also worked on a team (10+developers) to develop a task-based parallelism framework for numerical relativity called SpECTRE. On top of this, I was a member of the Nobel-prize winning LIGO collaboration, working on the neutrino and matter emission properties of binary neutron star mergers. This work has provided me with proficiency in C/C++, CMake, git, MPI and Python as well as experience with next-generation frameworks such as Charm++. 

To better prepare myself for a switch to the industry, I've been self-studying the field of machine-learning and quantitative finance.
