For my PhD, I have developed next generation numerical methods for solving the Einstein field equations (General Relativity) on supercomputers and implemented them in a self-maintained 100-200,000-line code available on GitHub. Iâ€™ve also worked on a team (10+developers) to develop a task-based parallelism framework for numerical relativity called SpECTRE. On top of this, I was a member of the Nobel-prize winning LIGO collaboration, working on the neutrino and matter emission properties of binary neutron star mergers. This work has provided me with proficiency in C/C++, CMake, git, MPI and Python as well as experience with next-generation frameworks such as Charm++. On top of this I have worked on scientific projects using both CUDA and OpenCL (~30-50,000 lines+).
